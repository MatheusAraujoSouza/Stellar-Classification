# Stellar Classification Project

Welcome to the Stellar Classification Project! This project aims to classify stars based on user-uploaded images using machine learning techniques. Users can upload star images through a web interface, and the backend system will process the images and provide classification results.

## Features

- Users can upload star images for classification.
- Backend system processes the uploaded images using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- The classification results are displayed to the user.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React (or any other preferred frontend framework)
- TensorFlow.js (or any other preferred machine learning library)
- HTML/CSS

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Train the machine learning model using your labeled star image dataset. Store the trained model in the appropriate location within the project structure.
4. Start the backend server: `npm run start:server`
5. Start the frontend development server: `npm run start:client`
6. Access the web application through your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

- `/backend` - Contains the backend server implementation.
- `/frontend` - Contains the frontend web page implementation.
- `/models` - Stores the pre-trained machine learning model.
- `/public` - Contains static files for the web page.
- `/src` - Source code files for both the backend and frontend.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/upload` - Receives an uploaded star image and initiates the classification process.
- *(Add any additional endpoints here if needed)*
